SMA Utilities

Manual SMA computation for a univariate price series and a convenience
function that returns pandas' rolling mean for reference/validation.

def compute_sma(series: pd.Series, window: int = 5) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Compute the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for a one-dimensional numeric Series.

    The SMA at each index represents the average of the most recent `window` 
    observations. If there are fewer than `window` data points available, 
    the result is NaN for that position.

    Args:
        series (pd.Series): Input numeric series (e.g., stock closing prices) 
            in chronological order.
        window (int): The number of consecutive observations to average. 
            Must be a positive integer.

    Returns:
        pd.Series: A Series of SMA values aligned with the input index. 
        The first `window - 1` positions will be NaN due to insufficient data.

    Notes:
        - Use a positive integer for `window`; non-positive values are invalid.
        - This function does not coerce non-numeric valuesâ€”ensure the input 
          Series is numeric before calling.
